# Linux script to run OCR functions for test
# it was originally inspired from this information :-
# https://github.com/baumanta/OCR_octave/blob/master/run_ocrad.sh
#
# tested with ocrad and then used tesseract
#
# ======================================================================
# use ocrad ocr engine
# install this with : sudo apt install ocrad
# results are okay with some error
# ======================================================================
# this line is outputting to the text file file.txt (only the numbers)
ocrad -a --filter=numbers_only --format=utf8 --output=file.txt $1
echo " ===== ocrad : with pnm file ============ "
# this line is outputting to the stdout in this case its piped back to 
# the python calling script which catches the std output into variable f
# format utf8 seemed to be needed to get better with different fonts
ocrad --format=utf8 $1
#ocrad $1
# ======================================================================
# using tesseract ocr engine instead (performance was better on tests)
# please refer to here 
# https://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr-devel
#
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/tesseract-ocr-devel 
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt install tesseract-ocr 
# results are a lot better than ocrad during my tests
# if you know the dots per inch for the input file you can use --dpi
#
# if you need another language e.g. welsh command is as below (cym is cymru)
# sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-cym
